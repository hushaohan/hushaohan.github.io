\section{\sc Research Interests}

My research interests include cyber-physical systems, mobile ubiquitous computing, crowd and social sensing, big data analytics, cloud computing, and quantum computing.

% I am interested in designing and building application-driven data-centric mobile systems that operate in self-contained as well as networked fashion to sense the physical and social environments, make inferences about their contexts and states, and provide services to individual users as well as the population.
