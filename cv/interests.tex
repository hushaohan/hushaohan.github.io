\section{\sc Research Interests}

I am broadly interested in IoT, Ubiquitous Computing, Computer Vision, Machine Learning, Augmented \& Virtual Reality, Quantum Computing, and Cloud Computing.

% My research interests include quantum computing, artificial intelligence, cloud computing, cyber-physical systems, mobile ubiquitous computing, crowd and social sensing, and big data analytics.

% I am interested in designing and building application-driven data-centric mobile systems that operate in self-contained as well as networked fashion to sense the physical and social environments, make inferences about their contexts and states, and provide services to individual users as well as the population.
